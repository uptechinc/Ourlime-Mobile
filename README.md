# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:# Ourlime Communities Network


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. For clarity on standards,
please see the [Ourlime Documentation](https://ourlime-documentation.vercel.app/)


### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/). Do not use any other package manager to ensure a consistant lockfile

### Installing
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/uptech2021/Ourlime
cd Ourlime
```
2. *Install Dependencies*

- Install the project dependencies using PNPM:
  ```sh
  pnpm install

4. *Set Up Environment Variables*

- Create a .env file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Contact [Aaron](https://github.com/A-Hazzard) for the variables

6. *Run the Development Server*

- Start the development server:
  ```sh
  pnpm dev
  ```

7. Before creating a pull request, run ```pnpm build``` to ensure there are no issues


```bash
